    <p> My academic and professional life has been a non-ending journey. </p>
    <p>Interested in Electromagnetics, I studied Electrical Engineering.
        Among other awards given by the University,
        I graduated with Honors (equals to Thesis with Honors plus
        an outstanding academic average grade).
        Strong analytical skills were developed,
        excelling in mathematics, physics, programming, electronics, etc. </p>
    <p> Later, I studied an MBA (Master in Business Administration),
        exploring the "other face" of the companies. I enjoyed the journey through
        Finances, Stock Markets, Strategy and Leadership (marketing was not my thing, though).
        </p>

    <p>The PhD brought me back to the engineering world, developing further research skills.
        While developing the understanding of nanoparticles within mineral oil, I strengthened
        also my laboratory skills when working with high-voltage, short transient,
        low energetic electric discharges (up to 20 kV, down to 5 Âµs and 1 ÂµJ).
        It was fun to fully automate the experimental work:
        through a computer program, all laboratory equipment was controlled, the experiment performed,
        the data acquired and processed. The research work involved also the simulation of the
        multi-physics phenomena present during the experiments. This was done through Comsol.
        Both experiments and simulation, made of the PhD plenty of fun and enriching experiences.
    </p>

    <p>The strong technical and MBA backgrounds allows me to contribute fully both within technical
        and business challenges of the companies. To date, there is no specific field I am settled at.
        I just want to work where I can serve best.</p>
